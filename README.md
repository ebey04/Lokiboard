## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Managing **responsive breakpoints** and scaling images with `max-width` / `height: auto`

- Controlling grid gaps, implicit rows, and alignment properties
- The importance of stepping back when frustrated — and coming back with fresh eyes 💪

## 🖤 Personal Reflection
This project was a challenge — but also my favorite so far.  
After hours of troubleshooting layout quirks, I finally got everything aligned exactly how I wanted. I learned how to **debug complex CSS interactions**, how to think like the browser, and how to push through when nothing seemed to work.  

This was the project that made CSS Grid *click.*
